# Rave-Beat
Rave beat is a rhythm game for console controllers, with a heavy focus on accessiblility and rhythm focused design, created as part of my final year development project at university.
It was an independent project that was created over the span on 6 months alongside a dissertation a which explains the thought, purpose and justification behind the design which is included in the root of the directory.
